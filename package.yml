    FocusWriter is a simple, distraction-free word processor. It utilizes a
    hide-away interface that you access by moving your mouse to the edges of
    the screen, allowing the program to have a familiar look and feel to it
    while still getting out of the way so that you can immerse yourself in
    your work.

    FocusWriter allows you to customize your environment by creating themes
    that control the font, colors, and background image to add ambiance. It
    also features on-the-fly updating statistics, daily goals, multiple open
    documents, spell-checking, and much more.

    Additionally, when you open the program your current work in progress will
    automatically load and position you where you last left off so that you
    can immediately jump back in.
